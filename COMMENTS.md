## Tasks

- Desktop layout 
- Improve UI(copy good pages)
- Move types to dev dependecies :white_check_mark:
- Rename date to timestamp :white_check_mark:
- Eslint rules, add not default imports
- Implement a form library
- Implement test.each
- Implement E2E with playwright
- Implement a custom render with React Test Library
- Move the heavy lifting to the context(low level components should be as dumb as possible)
- Fix the sorting(remove useEffect add SortOptions type)

## Consider

- Bundlephobia to check libraries size
- When writing tests try to break the code
- When writting a component ask, "What this component do?"
